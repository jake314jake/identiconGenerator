# identiconGenerator
An Identicon Generator is a avatar which represents a hash of unique information(from scratch)
## idea
Our Identicons are simple 5×5 “pixel”  that are generated using a hash of the user’s ID(input).
The algorithm walks through the hash and turns pixels
These generated patterns, combined with hash-determined color values, ensures a huge number of unique Identicons.
